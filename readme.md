# Git-Class — Simple Static Website Example

A small static website project used for learning Git and basic web development. This repository contains a few HTML pages, a CSS stylesheet, and a small JavaScript file. It's intended as an instructional/demo project for practicing commits, branches, and simple site editing.

## Contents

- `index.html` — Home page
- `about.html` — About page
- `Projects.html` — Projects / portfolio page
- `Contact.html` — Contact information / form page (static)
- `style.css` — Main stylesheet for site
- `script.js` — Small JavaScript file for interactive behavior
- `text.txt` — A plain text file included in the repo
- `readme.md` — This file

> Note: Filenames are case-sensitive on some systems; `Projects.html` uses a capital P in this repo.

## Purpose

This repository is a beginner-friendly demo to practice:

- Creating and editing files
- Committing changes with meaningful messages
- Creating and merging branches
- Hosting static sites (GitHub Pages or local preview)

## How to preview locally

1. Open the project folder in a browser directly by double-clicking `index.html`, or
2. Serve the folder using a simple HTTP server (recommended) to avoid issues with relative paths and fetch requests.

Using Python 3 (if installed):

```pwsh
# From project root (Windows PowerShell)
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Using Node (http-server):

```pwsh
# Install once globally (if you have Node.js)
npm install -g http-server
# From project root
http-server -p 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000
```

Or just open `index.html` directly in your browser for a quick preview.

## Development notes

- Keep markup semantic and accessible.
- Use the existing `style.css` for styling; add responsive rules as needed.
- If you add JavaScript that interacts with the DOM, ensure it runs after the DOMContentLoaded event or place scripts at the end of the body.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository (or create a branch if you have write access).
2. Make changes with clear commit messages.
3. Open a pull request describing your changes.

## License

This project doesn't include an explicit license file. If you plan to publish it, add a `LICENSE` file (for example, MIT) to clarify reuse permissions.
